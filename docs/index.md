## Related Experience

` `
__Data Wrangling, Aggregation, and Visualization__ | Python (Pandas, Numpy, Altair, Sklearn) R (Tidyverse, GGplot) SQL (MySQL)

This is the heart of data science, and this is what I excel at. I’ve been using and learning powerful libraries available to both Python and R (like Pandas and Tidyverse). With these tools I’ve made multiple beautiful, meaningful, visualizations and interpretations of complex data. My presentations and insights have been used in class demonstrations multiple times and have been praised by friends and fellow peers because of the work and effort it took to utilize these resources to their full potential. I believe It’s all about exploring and growing and teaching others these skills. I’ve also used SQL in multiple projects and have utilized its query syntax to aggregate and specify the exact data I need to work with, SQL queries are vital to this work and they are becoming an industry standard.

` `
__Statistical Analysis, Interpreting Data, Data Science__ | R (parametric and non-parametric tests, GGplot, Plotly, rMarkdown)

With my minor in statistics I’ve produced multiple statistical tests and with variety of interesting results. The findings that I have made using statistical methods and models are insightful and produce actionable direction for parties concerned. I have used my skill set to interpret data and decide on what test is most appropriate for said set of data. Using R is my go-to, especially with rMarkdown the quick and powerful ability to produce meaningful presentations of the data being analyzed.

` `
__Computer Programming, Software Engineering, Relational Database Design__ | Python, C++, MySQL

In the software engineering side of the tech industry, I have used pseudocode, ERD diagrams, and design documents to; build, engineer and test multiple programs and projects that range in their ability. I have built object-oriented programs in 2-d space and data manipulation programs for users. I have learned and used the most prevalent software engineering tools like loops, conditional statements, functions, objects, data types (distinguishing them), and file management in C++ and Python. I’ve also used tools like MySQL workbench to build and fill relational data bases that are scalable and accurate to application and client specs.

## Upcoming Experience...
